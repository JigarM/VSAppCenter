# Visual Studio App Center Nuggets

## Current Nuggets

- Slides from my App Center talk at the MN Enterprise Mobile meetup on 1/18/18

### Scripts

- Post clone script for slipping your App Center SDK secret keys (or other API keys) into a file named ApiKeys.cs in your project. No need to check sensitive keys into source control. ApiKeys.cs file included as well. See blog post for more details: https://www.jimbobbennett.io/hiding-api-keys-from-git  

- Post build script for kicking off UI tests in Test Cloud as part of your App Center builds. Goes hand in hand with this blog post: https://tomsoderling.github.io/AppCenter-Automated-UI-tests-on-build/
